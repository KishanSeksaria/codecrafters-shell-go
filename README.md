This is my solution to the ["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview) by CodeCrafters. This is my first project on golang, and would love any feedback and suggestions.

All the basic features of a shell are implemented. Commands like `echo`, `cd`, `exit`, `pwd`, `cat`
and `type` have custom implementations based on the challenge, while any other built-in commands can
be executed if they are available in path.
